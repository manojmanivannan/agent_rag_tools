Review: This is a very good and basic shaver without all of the extras. It shaves as close as the more expensive models but does not have all of the bells and whistles. My biggest complaint is that you can not shave while it is charging, which I think is a major flaw. Overall I like it and for the money I am very satisfied with it.\\', rating = 4.0, summary = \\'Good deal for the money.. Have had this shaving system for nearly 3 weeks.

As always I get excellent shaves with Norelco. My only complaint would be their continued use of NiCad batteries. If they would switch to NiMH I wouldn\\'t have to run the batteries down before recharging them, which can be inconvenient.\\', rating = 4.0, summary = \\'excellent performance.

Review: I bought this shaver because of its slim design. I was hoping it would replace my traditional razor, but I was wrong. It didn\\'t shave well and I had to make several passes before I got good results. As with other reviewers, I had issues with the blade guard falling off. After 6 months it was unusable because the blade guard just would not stay on. I called Norelco customer service and they sent me a new guard. The new guard fell off less than 5 minutes after I put it on. There\\'s definitely something faulty with the clips that are supposed to hold it in place. I was so fed-up Moi for Me went right into the trash.\\', rating = 1.0, summary = \\'Disappointing.

I have tried and tried to get my razor to charge and it will not do so. Since I did away with the packaging I did not think it could be returned so I am indebted for $28.00 for a product that does not work. As you can imagine, I am not very happy with this purchase.\\', rating = 1.0, summary = \\'Very disappointed. Instructions were charge for 16 hrs., however, it never charged.

This razor does a nice consistent job and does not have any issues as of yet.\\', rating = 5.0, summary = \\'Good Shaver Great Price. This electric razor is an example of poor constuction.

Review: I went through two of these over the last 3 years. The first one failed after one yea I received a replacement from Norelco because it was still under warrenty. The second one lasted two years. I opened it up and it appeared the motor burned out. There was a burnt smell coming from the moto I liked the shave but these things just do not last very long. I have a 15 yr old 885RX and it works great. Still gives a pretty good shsve. You can see the difference in quality. The 885RX had much better construction than the 8140. I just ordered a Panasonic ES7103K. The reviews indicate it is well constructed.\\', rating = 1.0, summary = \\'Good shave, but does not last long. works great\\', rating = 4.0, summary = \\'Four Stars. Thought I would see a difference. I should have saved my money\\', rating = 2.0, summary = \\'Save your money. Still works well after 6 years of usage and more convenient design than the newest 2D Norelco models. It works also quitely than the newest 2D handsome blue-design model, which has trimmer only as an attachment, not as a part of the main body. Do not waste your money buying the newest Norelco otherwise handsome blue-colored models, this works as well for less money. Definitely the better value for your money!\\', rating = 5.0, summary = \\'Better model than the newest blue-design Norelco models!. I really can\\'t complain about this shave I bought it in November of 2005, which is nine years ago, and it is still working, and the battery has only just begun to seem like it needs to be charged a little more often (maybe every 2 weeks now - I don\\'t keep close track). Based on longevity alone, I can\\'t fault it. As for the shave, \"Meh.\" It doesn\\'t cut, scrape, or pull, and it doesn\\'t hurt. It doesn\\'t shave super-close, and, frankly, when I replaced the cutters after about 8 years, I didn\\'t notice a significant improvement. I did not expect a super-close razor shave when I got it, as I have the kind of beard that produces a five o\\'clock shadow at noon, so who would really notice if it showed up at 11, and shaving with an electric is much simpler and faster, and, in an emergency, can be done almost anywhere (I was a medical resident when I bought it, so being able to shave in inhospitable surroundings had become important). If you want a shaver that will give good service, but aren\\'t obsessed with closeness, this one will do the job, and may save you a LOT of money on razors and shaving cream if you use it for as long as I did.\\', rating = 4.0, summary = \\'Durable, but Not a Super-Close Shave.\\nProduct: Factory Reconditioned Remington WDF-3000RBP Smooth &amp; Silky Rechargeable Shaver. Review: I ordered this with some trepidation, having used electric razors before and found them pretty useless...ineffectual. I used disposable razors for years but ultimately got tired of carving myself up & stopped shaving altogethe Then I read a review of the newer electrics elsewhere, which referred to this model as the \"BMW of shavers\". They also noted many people were equally satified with the lower end model-so I came to Amazon looking for that one, and found this, reconditioned for about the same price. I have to admit that I bought it fully expecting not to be satified but got a pleasant suprise. It is almost as close as a razor! All that said, if you\\'ve been unsatified with other electrics, this one is worth a try.\\', rating = 5.0, summary = \\'it works!. This is a great rechargeable razor for daily use and I couldn\\'t find parts for my old one anywhere so I ordered this one. It is working well and the blades and foil are so smooth. Thank you\\', rating = 5.0, summary = \\'Great Razor for the price. Wow, where have you been all my life? At first, after using Norelco triple headers since college, I didn\\'t like this razor because the foil pulled at all my hairs. But, after I found out that you have to use the scissor action blades first, I love the second follow-up closeness with the foils. I think that my wife likes the frequency of my shaving a lot better now!\\', rating = 5.0, summary = \\'No more mountain man!. Good price and shaves close.

For some reason, my husband always insisted on a corded razo He finally gave up the cord and loves this razo He can shave while walking around, in the car, or anywhere he chooses.

Based on longevity alone, I can\\'t fault it. As for the shave, \"Meh.\" It doesn\\'t cut, scrape, or pull, and it doesn\\'t hurt. It doesn\\'t shave super-close, and, frankly, when I replaced the cutters after about 8 years, I didn\\'t notice a significant improvement. I did not expect a super-close razor shave when I got it, as I have the kind of beard that produces a five o\\'clock shadow at noon, so who would really notice if it showed up at 11, and shaving with an electric is much simpler and faster, and, in an emergency, can be done almost anywhere (I was a medical resident when I bought it, so being able to shave in inhospitable surroundings had become important). If you want a shaver that will give good service, but aren\\'t obsessed with closeness, this one will do the job, and may save you a LOT of money on razors and shaving cream if you use it for as long as I did.\\', rating = 4.0, summary = \\'Durable, but Not a Super-Close Shave.\\nProduct: Factory Reconditioned Remington WDF-3000RBP Smooth &amp; Silky Rechargeable Shaver.
